# Front-end Development 
-  This task was the most challenging task to me as I was new to web development. I had no knowledge in ReactJS, NextJS and had to learn most of it from the scratch. I couldn't complete the task within the given Time frame. I have just done basic view of Homepage, Create Account and Sign pages only. I couldn't implement most of the functionalities and couldn't do the API fetching for films. However this task opened my interest in Web development and I am looking forward to grab more concepts on it in the future.
-  I am attaching my partially completed code for the Letterboxd Inspired Website. I am sorry I couldn't complete it.
